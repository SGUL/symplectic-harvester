# The -e flag prevents the script from continuing even though a tool fails.
#	Continuing after a tool failure is undesirable since the harvested
#	data could be rendered corrupted and incompatible.

# Supply the location of the detailed log file which is generated during the script.
#	If there is an issue with a harvest, this file proves invaluable in finding
#	a solution to the problem. It has become common practice in addressing a problem
#	to request this file. The passwords and usernames are filtered out of this file
#	to prevent these logs from containing sensitive information.

#clear old data
# For a fresh harvest, the removal of the previous information maintains data integrity.
#	If you are continuing a partial run or wish to use the old and already retrieved
#	data, you will want to comment out this line since it could prevent you from having
# 	the required harvest data.  
# rm -rf data
# cp -r datasafe data

# Execute Fetch
# This stage of the script is where the information is gathered together into one local
#	place to facilitate the further steps of the harvest. The data is stored locally
#	in a format based off of the source. The format is a form of RDF but not in the VIVO ontology
# The symplecticFetch tool in particular takes the data from the chosen source described in its
#	configuration XML file and places it into record set in the flat RDF directly 
#	related to the rows, columns and tables described in the target database.
